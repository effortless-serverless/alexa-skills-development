# 3 Alexa How to Pizza

## Starting with what you already know

You have completed your first static Pizza Alexa Skill Intents, but now you need to learn how to use Intent Slots (analoguos to function parameters). You need to expand your knowledge and ask for certain pizzas and ingredients.

### Prerequisites for this task

* Have finished the previous task
* Install and Setup [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)

### Goal

Your main goal is to expand this Alexa Skill with an Intent that accepts an Ingredient name, to filter and reply with the current pizzas that contain the ingredient.
